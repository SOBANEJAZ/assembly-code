;DosBox program is required to run the file that I have attached because that uses DOS-based x86 assembly language
; thats why i put the code in .txt



dosseg
.model small
.stack 100h

.data
    hello db 'Hello, World!', 0

.code
main proc
    mov dl, offset hello   ; Load the offset of the hello string into dl
    mov ah, 9              ; Set the function code 9 (display string)
    int 21h                ; Call the DOS interrupt 21h to print the string

    mov ah, 4Ch            ; Set the function code 4Ch (program termination)
    int 21h                ; Call the DOS interrupt 21h to terminate the program
main endp

end main
