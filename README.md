# Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language invented in 1940s by 'David John Wheeler'. It provides a direct correspondence between instructions and machine code. It is specific to a particular processor architecture and allows programmers to write code using mnemonic instructions and operands. Assembly language offers fine-grained control over hardware resources and is highly efficient.

## Requirements
- DosBox program is required to run the file that I have attached because that  uses DOS-based x86 assembly language

## Reasons to Study

- Better/Deep understanding of software and hardware interaction
- optimising the processing time
- Embedded programming

## Main Concept
